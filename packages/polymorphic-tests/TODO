Current release:
  These should be tested against a summary reporter that
    takes the finished event stream and returns standard
    report data structure (proprietary format, passed to
    all summary reporters).

      ✔ Separate TestReporter to abstract with delegate stuff and abstract summary coupled to simple @started(19-09-26 14:06) @done(19-09-26 14:15) @lasted(9m20s)
      ✔ Have running test entities return observables instead of promises, have abstract summary subscribe @started(19-09-26 14:15) @done(19-09-26 15:05) @lasted(50m17s)
    ✔ Propagate global config timeout to test entity run and support in run observable @done(19-10-02 12:59)

    ✘ Cancelability @cancelled(19-10-03 10:48)
      ✔ First, see if other frameworks implement a better solution @done(19-10-03 10:47)
          None of them solve this, it's impossible to externally stop a given running function's execution in JS
      ✘ If not, look into static code analysis (specifically CyPress's) approach @cancelled(19-10-03 10:48)
          Couldn't even get CyPress to run
      ✘ If not, look into running test in worker, but this will have to be implemented by either @cancelled(19-10-03 11:04)
        ✘ Using importScripts to import the whole suite, and somehow run the test on the clone; @cancelled(19-10-03 11:04)
        ✘ Copying the clone over, and somehow also copying over its closure (e.g. imports in test suite file like a func under test); or, @cancelled(19-10-03 11:04)
        ✘ Using static analysis, importScripts all imports in test suite file, then copy clone over and run in correct context @cancelled(19-10-03 11:04)
    ✔ Refactor @done(19-10-03 14:35)
      ✔ Fix process hanging after run ending @started(19-10-03 14:25) @done(19-10-03 14:34) @lasted(9m13s)
  ✔ Fail parent suite when children fail @done(19-10-02 12:25)

  ✔ Skip suites and tests @done(19-10-06 16:40)
  ✔ Run only suites and tests marked with only in given suite @done(19-10-06 16:40)
  ✔ Override only with skip @done(19-10-06 16:54)

  ✔ Throw error when suite class doesn't extends TestSuite @done(19-10-06 17:05)
  
  Polymorphic tests:
    ✔ Run suite defined through decorator interface @done(19-10-06 19:00)
    ✔ Run polymorphic tests in separate polymorphic suite instances @done(19-10-06 19:00)
    ✔ Inherit tests and lifecycle hooks from abstract suite @done(19-10-06 19:05)
      ✔ Run inherited tests from abstract to specific @started(19-10-06 18:40) @done(19-10-06 18:59) @lasted(19m30s)
      ✔ Don't run test without only in suite that inherits test with only @started(19-10-06 19:00) @done(19-10-06 19:05) @lasted(5m21s)

  Reporters:
    Live:
      Get access to raw event stream
      TAP:
        ✔ Report empty suite @done(19-10-10 13:55)
        ✔ Report passing test @done(19-10-10 13:55)
        ✔ Report skipped tests @done(19-10-10 13:55)
        ✔ Report failing tests @done(19-10-10 13:55)
          ✔ Add expected and actual to errors @done(19-10-10 16:51)
      Raw:
        Parses finished event stream to standard report (JSON? YAML?)
        The base summary reporter class wraps this reporter
        ✔ Parse event stream to standard report @done(19-10-28 15:46)
    Summary:
      Simple:
        ✔ Extend base summary reporter class to report based on standard summary @done(19-11-20 13:21)

✔ Add component lifecycle protected hook in WebComponentSuite to wait for component initialization and capture any async errors @done(19-11-20 13:21)

Next release:
  ☐ Enter to rerun in watch mode
  ☐ Skipped tests (at least via only) get timeout errors when proceeding tests time out (probably)
  ☐ Figure out what to do with:
    ☐ Failed tests with an after hook that also fails. Which error to report?
  ✔ Run meta tests directly without stupid hack @done(19-11-20 13:21)
  ☐ Add assertion reporting
    ☐ Run test with passing assertions
    ☐ Run test with failing assertion
    ☐ Add lifecycle hooks to suite
  ☐ Add failure modes
    ☐ Run multiple failing suites and bail after first failure
    ☐ Run multiple failing suites and stop suite after first contained failed test
    ☐ Run multiple failing suites and run all tests regardless of failure
  ✔ Add decorators for only/skip (Possibly as @Test.only.skip()) @done(20-02-12 14:02)
  ☐ Make fancy reporter
